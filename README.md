# Target-Tracking-with-Linear MPC
This repository deals with autonomous target tracking of a horse using a quadcopter. The tracking is based on object recognition, which is not discussed here. The implementations in ROS with the programming language C++ contained here concentrate on navigation planning with model predictive control. The linear and convex optimisation problem was performed with the CVXGEN solver. The simulation was realised with the tool Gazebo.
